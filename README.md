# Introduction

This is my capstone project for Udaciry Scientist Nano Degree. I will use the skills I have learned in this class to analyze the data and build model.

# Motivation
 
Starbucks is a world-wide known coffeehouse. It has many promotion events and even has it's own app by which the members can receive the latest promotion information. There are many other local coffee shops or even other chain coffee stores where Starbucks locate. Therefore, Starbucks have to do marketing strategy to increase their revenue and compete with the rivals. I am interested in discovering actionable business strategy and improving current strategies. Hence, I will provide the suggestions to Starbucks which might help them to improve their promotion results.
